# Study Notes on Scala Concepts from Quiz 4

<details>
<summary>1. List Length Transformation (Question 1)</summary>

Consider the Scala function:

```scala
def f[X](xs: List[X]): List[X] = {
  xs match {
    case Nil   => Nil
    case y::ys => y::(y::(f(ys)))
  }
}
```

### Concept:
- This function duplicates each element in the list, resulting in a list that is longer than the original.

### Result:
- If executed on a list of length \( N \), the length of the resulting list is \( 2N - 1 \).

### Explanation:
- Each element \( y \) leads to two occurrences of \( y \) in the output list.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Concatenating Lists (Question 2)</summary>

Consider the Scala function:

```scala
def f[X](xs: List[X], ys: List[X]): List[X] = {
  xs match {
    case Nil   => ys
    case z::zs => z::(f(zs, ys))
  }
}
```

### Concept:
- This function concatenates two lists by prepending elements from the first list to the second.

### Result:
- If executed on two lists of lengths \( M \) and \( N \), the length of the resulting list is \( M + N \).

### Explanation:
- Each element of the first list \( xs \) is added to the output list until \( xs \) is empty.

</details>

<details>
<summary>3. List Reversal (Question 3)</summary>

Consider the Scala function:

```scala
def f[X](xs: List[X]): List[X] = {
  xs match {
    case Nil   => Nil
    case y::ys => f(ys) ::: List(y)
  }
}
```

### Concept:
- This function reverses a list by recursively calling itself and appending the head element to the end.

### Example:
- For the input `val myList: List[(Int, Int)] = List((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6))`, the result is:
  - `f(myList)` produces `List((5, 6), (3, 4), (1, 2))`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Filtering and Mapping Lists (Question 4)</summary>

Given the code:

```scala
List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).filter((x: Int) => (x % 2) == 0).map((x: Int) => x * 2)
```

### Concept:
- This code filters out even numbers from the list and then doubles them.

### Result:
- The output is `List(4, 8, 12, 16, 20)`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Mapping and Filtering Lists (Question 5)</summary>

Given the code:

```scala
List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).map((x: Int) => x * 2).filter((x: Int) => (x % 2) == 0)
```

### Concept:
- This code first doubles each element and then filters out the odd results.

### Result:
- The output is `List(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>6. For-Comprehensions (Question 6)</summary>

Consider the function:

```scala
def f[X](xss: ?1): ?2 = for (xs <- xss; x <- xs) yield x
```

### Type Parameters:
- `?1`: `List[List[X]]`
- `?2`: `List[X]`

### Concept:
- This function flattens a list of lists into a single list.

</details>

<details>
<summary>7. Higher-Order Functions (Question 7)</summary>

Consider the function:

```scala
def g[X, Y](xs: ?1, f: ?2): ?3 = {
  xs match {
    case Nil   => Nil
    case y::ys => f(y) :: g(ys, f)
  }
}
```

### Type Parameters:
- `?1`: `List[X]`
- `?2`: `X => Y`
- `?3`: `List[Y]`

### Concept:
- This function applies a function `f` to each element in the list.

</details>

<details>
<summary>8. Tail Recursion (Question 8)</summary>

Consider the function:

```scala
def f[X](xs: List[X], ys: List[X]): List[X] = {
  xs match {
    case Nil   => ys
    case z::zs => z::(f(zs, ys))
  }
}
```

### True or False:
- This function is **not** tail-recursive.

### Explanation:
- The recursive call is not the last operation performed.

</details>

<details>
<summary>9. Tail Recursion (Question 9)</summary>

Consider the function:

```scala
def f[X](xs: List[X]): List[X] = {
  xs match {
    case Nil   => Nil
    case y::ys => f(ys) ::: List(y)
  }
}
```

### True or False:
- This function is **not** tail-recursive.

### Explanation:
- Similar to the previous example, the recursive call is followed by another operation (the concatenation).

</details>

<details>
<summary>10. Tail Recursion (Question 10)</summary>

Consider the function:

```scala
def f[X](xs: List[X], ys: List[X]): List[X] = {
  xs match {
    case Nil   => ys
    case z::zs => f(zs, z::ys)
  }
}
```

### True or False:
- This function **is** tail-recursive.

### Explanation:
- The recursive call is the last operation, allowing for optimization.
